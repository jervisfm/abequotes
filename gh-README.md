# abequotes
Abe Quotes Web Archive

## Changes
We updated the `quotesCtrl.js` file under abe-quotes_file so that it loads our local
JSON data for archiving purposes.

Note alos that the `abe_quotes.js` and `abe_quotes_local.js` have precedence in loading
data.

## Opening Local site
To open this site locally, just open the `index_local.html` file

Otherwise for deployment on GH, one should use the `index.html` entry point file. 

One about Github pages is that the initial path component has to be repo name so in this case, it's `/abequotes`.

## Status / Progress
- Confirmed that local data JSON working.
- Update image URIs: done and confirmed working.
